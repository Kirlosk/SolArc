            <!-- Why SolArc for India Section -->
            <div class="about-card fade-in-section">
                <div class="card-icon">🇮🇳</div>
                <h2 class="card-title">Why SolArc for India</h2>
                <p class="card-text">
                    India stands at a critical juncture in its energy transition. With ambitious targets to achieve 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070, accurate forecasting has become essential. Karnataka, as one of India's renewable energy leaders, presents unique challenges with its diverse climate zones—from the humid coastal regions of Karwar to the urban heat island effects of Bengaluru and the moderate central plains around Hassan.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    SolArc addresses these challenges through region-specific modeling. Our three specialized models capture the distinct weather patterns and solar characteristics of coastal, urban, and central Karnataka. As solar and wind capacity expands across India, grid stability becomes increasingly dependent on accurate production forecasts. Traditional methods fail to account for micro-climate variations, leading to costly imbalances and curtailment.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    By providing hourly, daily, and multi-day forecasts for 240+ cities, SolArc enables better energy trading, optimal dispatch scheduling, and improved grid integration. Our system helps reduce India's reliance on fossil fuel backup, minimize renewable energy waste, and accelerate the country's path to energy independence and climate goals.

                <div class="card-icon">🤖</div>
                <h2 class="card-title">Model Architecture & Performance</h2>
                <p class="card-text">
                    SolArc employs XGBoost gradient-boosted regression trees optimized for renewable energy forecasting. Our system uses three region-specific models trained on historical weather data and solar production patterns:

                <div class="tech-grid">
                    <div class="tech-item">
                        <h4>Karwar Model (Coastal)</h4>
                        <p>Trained for high-humidity coastal regions with monsoon patterns. Handles variable cloud cover and sea breeze effects on solar irradiance.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tech-item">
                        <h4>Hassan Model (Central)</h4>
                        <p>Optimized for moderate climate zones with stable weather patterns. Captures agricultural region characteristics and seasonal variations.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tech-item">
                        <h4>Bengaluru Model (Urban)</h4>
                        <p>Accounts for urban heat island effects, air pollution impacts, and metropolitan weather patterns affecting solar generation.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Each model uses six key features: POA ground-reflected irradiance, solar elevation angle, ambient temperature, wind speed, latitude, and longitude. StandardScaler normalization ensures consistent predictions across different magnitudes. The models predict irradiance (W/m²), which is then converted to energy output (kWh) based on panel area and efficiency.

                <h2 class="card-title">Environmental Impact</h2>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Accurate renewable energy forecasting plays a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions. By enabling grid operators to better integrate solar and wind power, SolArc helps minimize the need for fossil fuel backup generation. Every percentage point improvement in forecast accuracy translates to reduced curtailment, better energy trading decisions, and more efficient grid operations.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    For Karnataka alone, improved forecasting can help avoid thousands of tons of CO₂ emissions annually by maximizing renewable energy utilization and reducing reliance on coal-based peaking plants. As India scales its renewable capacity, tools like SolArc become essential infrastructure for achieving climate targets while maintaining grid reliability.
